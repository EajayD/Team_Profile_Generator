This is a simple team generator which allows you to organize your employees based on if they are an engineer or an intern. You can add as many engineers and interns as you want after initially adding the manager of the team. Manager's will have their emails and office numbers, Engineers will have their Github linked, and Interns will have information on the school they went to. Installation and steps to install follow.
